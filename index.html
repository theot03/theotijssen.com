          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>My name is Theo Tijssen and I am an enthusiastic software engineer. I'm currently the Senior Application Developer at MPX. Working mainly with PHP and MySQL, I develop custom document composition applications for a broad range of industries that include Energy, Healthcare, Insurance, Telecommunications and Financial Services. I have a proven track record in both development as well as project management, while also exceeding expectations. </p>
          <p>I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering, with a focus in Computer Engineering, from the University of Southern Maine in 2013. While at USM, I served on the Engineering Student Committee and helped with many initiatives that included funding and student activities. Some relevant courses included Data Structurs, Object Oriented Design, Microprocessor Systems, Differential Equations, Circuits and Electronics.

          <h2>Technical</h2>
          <p>I have always had a passion for technology. I was a member of the robotics club and built my first PC in high school (Intel Q6600, EVGA GeForce 8800, 2GB Crucial Ballistix RAM, etc.). My first experience with programming languages was with basic HTML/CSS and building websites for fun. In college my focus turned more towards back-ends and object oriented design. In college I wrote programs in Java, Python and C. In my professional career I work mainly with PHP and MySQL. Recently I have been getting more involved in data science and improving my MySQL skills. I have also been experimenting with Amazon Web Services. I built this site on AWS, building an EC2 instance from scratch with LAMP stack and RDS with MySQL.</p>
          <h2>Non-Technical</h2>
          <p>I'm a big sports buff. I enjoy watching basketball, football and baseball. More than watching, I love looking at sports stats and analysis. Sabermetrics, or the empirical anaylsis of statistics to measure in-game activity, is extremely interesting to me and I believe it to be the future of sports.</p>
